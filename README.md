# tinysphinx

### Install

This is a very tiny [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application. Because of this, it is highly recommended that you use a [python virtualenvironment]() to get set up. For a how-to on getting set up, please consult this [howto](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Python-Virtualenv.md).

Once you have created your virtual environment, follow these instructions to bootstrap your environment:

```bash
https://github.com/<your_fork>/tinysphinx
cd tinysphinx
pip install -r requirements.txt
python tinysphinx.py
```

You should now have your very own tinysphinx app running at 127.0.0.1:9000.
